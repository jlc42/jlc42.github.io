  <!-- GOAL:
    There are two different issues, a "what do we do quickly for now" and a "what will this look like longer term".

    For now, I think we need a place-holder front page, with a link to the blog with my daily updates... and then some sort of auto-index (possibly with thumbnails) so people can get to the existing figures, which currently include testing/case data for each state, with the scale set so that if the testing data goes above the case data, you have a larger than 10% positivity rate. So... the goal would be to keep the cases line below the testing line in the graphs, when they are inverted, a state is in trouble.  So beyond just a directory listing, there should be SOME description of that that goes with the figures. I also have figures for a run of rt.live's algorithm, but on the whole us instead of a per/state level, which they don't do. So it would be nice to give a link to that as well.

    But as time goes on I hope to add many different additional views for each state. I'm hoping to add things like % tests positive, and then the really interesting things... using a full Hierarchical Bayesian Model to estimate how many have actually been infected/are currently infected with good uncertainty bounds...Then I might possibly expand some of this to other countries. 

    So eventually, we would need something flexible that will give a reasonable ui so people can choose what figures / data they want to view, from a rather long list of options... while making sure it all makes sense. 

    Honestly, I have no idea what the best way is to arrange all that, nor have I kept up with HTML and the various scripting tools people use these days (thus my call for help).
