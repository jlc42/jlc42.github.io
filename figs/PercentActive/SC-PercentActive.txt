The true number of infections is far larger than the number of officially reported cases. Using the population size, estimated recoveries, and estimated infections it's possible to compute an estimate of the population that are actively infected in a given location. This is a useful estimate of individual risk, because it gives you an idea of how likely it is that you will interact with a person who is actively contagious. If 2% of the population in your region are actively infected, then in a randomly chosen group of 100 people, on average, 2 of them will be contageous.
