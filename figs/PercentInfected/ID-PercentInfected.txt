The true number of infections is far larger than the number of officially reported cases. One way to estimate the true number of infections from reported cases and the percent of tests that are positive was proposed by Youyang Gu: true-new-daily-infections = daily-confirmed-cases * (16 * (positivity-rate)^(0.5) + 2.5). (see: https://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections/). The cumulative percent of the population that has been infected so far is an important first step towards extimating the fraction of the population that will be immune in a given location.
