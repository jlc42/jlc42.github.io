So... the goal would be to keep the cases line below the testing line in the graphs, when they are inverted, a state is in trouble.  So beyond just a directory listing, there should be SOME description of that that goes with the figures. I also have figures for a run of rt.live's algorithm, but on the whole us instead of a per/state level, which they don't do. So it would be nice to give a link to that as well.\n\n// But as time goes on I hope to add many different additional views for each state. I'm hoping to add things like % tests positive, and then the really interesting things... using a full Hierarchical Bayesian Model to estimate how many have actually been infected/are currently infected with good uncertainty bounds...Then I might possibly expand some of this to other countries. \n\n// So eventually, we would need something flexible that will give a reasonable ui so people can choose what figures / data they want to view, from a rather long list of options... while making sure it all makes sense. \n\n// Honestly, I have no idea what the best way is to arrange all that, nor have I kept up with HTML and the various scripting tools people use these days (thus my call for help). \n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"main\">\n    \n      <h1>JLC42</h1>\n      <a href=\"https://jlcarroll.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Link to blog</a>\n      <h2>Cases and Tests</h2>\n      <div id=\"casesNTests\" class=\"casesNTests\">\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Component that holds the state case charts\nconst CasesByState = () => {\n  let states = [\"AK\", \"AL\", \"AR\", \"AZ\", \"CA\", \"CO\", \"CT\", \"DC\", \"DE\", \"FL\", \"GA\", \"HI\", \"IA\", \"ID\", \"IL\", \"IN\", \"KS\", \"KY\", \"LA\", \"MA\", \"MD\", \"ME\", \"MI\", \"MN\", \"MO\", \"MS\", \"MT\", \"NC\", \"ND\", \"NE\", \"NH\", \"NJ\", \"NM\", \"NV\", \"NY\", \"OH\", \"OK\", \"OR\", \"PA\", \"RI\", \"SC\", \"SD\", \"TN\", \"TX\", \"UT\", \"VA\", \"VT\", \"WA\", \"WI\", \"WV\", \"WY\"];\n  // for (let i = 0; i < states.length; i++) {\n  //   let caseLong = \"./figs/casesNTests/\" + states[i] + \"-Daily Cases and Tests.png\";\n  // }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      \n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
